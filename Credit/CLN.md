Credit-Linked Note (CLN)

The biggest difference between CDOs and CLNs is that CDOs are backed by a pool of assets, while CLNs are backed by a pool of liabilities. 
This means that if the underlying assets perform poorly, the investors in the CDO will lose money, while the investors in the CLN will make money.

buy CLNs = sell CDS
